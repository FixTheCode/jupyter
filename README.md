    - Extracting multiple name from a large block of text
    - Basic OCR and name extraction

The tech tools used are:
    
    - spaCy 
        an industrial stength natural language processing library
    - tesseract and pytesseract
        a popular OCR library and Python wrapper for it
    - Pillow
